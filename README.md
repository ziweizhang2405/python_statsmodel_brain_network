### Python statistical models for analyzing functional brain networks

In this repository, I included the main analysis models used to study the effects of aging and dementia severity on brain system segregation (manuscript submitted).

#### Required python libraries
Several python libraries were used to conduct statistical analyses. <br>
Pandas and numpy are for handling dataframes and correlation matrices. <br>
Statsmodel is required to perform multiple linear regression analyses. <br>
Seaborn is used for generating plots.

### Python statistical models for analyzing functional brain networks

In this repository, I included the main analysis models used to study the effects of aging and dementia severity in the submitted manuscript.

#### Required python libraries
Several python libraries were used to conduct statistical analyses.
Pandas and numpy are for handling dataframes and correlation matrices. 
Statsmodel is required to perform multiple linear regression analyses. 
Seaborn is used for generating plots included in the manuscript.

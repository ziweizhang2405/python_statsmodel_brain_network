#### Required python libraries
Several python libraries were used when conducting statistical analyses: <br>
- Pandas and numpy were used for handling dataframes and correlation matrices. <br>
- Statsmodel was used for performing multiple linear regression and linear mixed-model regression analyses. <br>
- Seaborn was used for generating figures, including scatterplots and boxplots.
